# Deep_learning_toolbox

## description
A set of Deep Learning Projects I built while I am taking the Deep Learning Lectures from Prof Andrew Ng. This is for my learning and exploring deep learning algorithms and architectures.

## Projects
* Parlour - A Deep Neural Network flow built from scratch with Numpy





__Ever wonder how I come up with the naming for the project?__
